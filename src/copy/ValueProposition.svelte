  Ion puts your data to work to address some of today’s most pressing technology
  concerns, like misinformation, data privacy, and ethical AI. The data you
  agree to share with Mozilla (the makers of Firefox) helps create tools for
  better internet transparency and design products that give control back to the
  people who use them. As a Ion participant, you’ll also have the option to
  contribute your data to studies sponsored by research institutions and other
  organizations.
