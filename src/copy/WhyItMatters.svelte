  Ion puts your data to work for a better internet. Our goal is to better
  understand topics like internet usage, online privacy, algorithmic bias,
  discrimination, and misinformation. This in turn can lead to new products that
  fundamentally change the tech landscape and hand more power and control back
  to users.
